# Detecting_Physical_Activity_ECG
* This repository is from a project called: "Identification of Physical Activity Through Artificial Intelligence Models in Processing ECG signs" where we use Heart Rate Variability to classify if a person is in physical activity or not
* We use signs with the protocol of 2 minutes in rest, 2 minutos of physical activity and 2 minutes of recovery
